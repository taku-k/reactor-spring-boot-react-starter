# Reactor + Spring Boot & React + Redux-Observable Starter Project

A starter using Spring-Boot and Reactor for backend, and using React, Redux, ES6 + JSX via Babel, and RxJS + Redux-Observable for frontend.
React structure follows [the Ducks pattern](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) â€” approach when each module's entry file (`feature-name.js`) contains all of its related constants, actions/action creators, selectors, its reducer and its epic which is the core primitive of redux-observable.

This starter is powered by the following technology stack:

- [x] [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)
- [x] [Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/)
- [x] [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/)
- [x] [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
- [x] [RxJS](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/)
- [x] [redux-observable](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable)
- [x] [Webpack 2](https://gist.github.com/sokra/27b24881210b56bbaff7) and [dev middleware](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware)
- [x] [Reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect)
- [x] [ESLint](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring)
- [ ] [Flow](https://flowtype.org/docs/getting-started.html)
